# File Encrypter/Decrypter

This C++ tool uses the Caesar cipher to encrypt and decrypt files and directories on a byte level. It reads the encryption key from a `.env` file and employs multithreading for enhanced performance.

## Features

- **Byte-Level Encryption/Decryption:** Uses the Caesar cipher for files and directories.
- **Multithreading:** Speeds up processing with multiple threads.
- **C++17:** Developed with C++17.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atharvaa12/FileEncrpyter-Decrpyter.git
   ```


2. **Build the project**
  

## Usage

1. **Create a `.env` file in the working directory with the encryption key (e.g., `3`).**

2. **Run the program:**

## Notes

- Ensure the `.env` file is correctly formatted and present in the working directory.
- The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique and may not be suitable for secure applications.
